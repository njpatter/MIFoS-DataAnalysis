# MIFoS-DataAnalysis

This repo contains all of the files for my final capstone project in the HarvardX Data Science series.

The main data analysis script saves the R Studio workspace at the end. The workspace file is then loaded by the Rmd file for generating tables and plots.

If you want to run the Rmd file you will also need the 'references.bib' file and 'Figure-1.jpg' file.
